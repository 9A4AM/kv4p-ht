KV4P HT privacy policy
----------------------

This app is open source, and as such its code may be fully reviewed, reused, and reopurposed by end users however they like.
KV4P HT Android app does not transmit any user data outside of the user's own device. Settings are stored locally on the user's
device in an Android Room DB, which keeps them secure on the user's device. That said, there's no sensitive data used or
stored even locally by the app.

(This privacy policy is here because it's required to be referenced to publish the app in the Play Store.)
